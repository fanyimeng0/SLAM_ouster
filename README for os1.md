Ouster provides two visual tools for ouster.

For ouster SDK (https://github.com/ouster-lidar/ouster_example),python >= 3.8 is required. However runtime error occurs when downloading it from pypi.

For ouster ros,(https://github.com/ouster-lidar/ouster-ro)s since ros1 only supports python2.7, we use conda and build ros1.
